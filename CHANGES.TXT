--TODO--


--0.7--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8

   !	Configure and build changes to reflect changes in libsnert.

--0.6--

   !	Corrections of compiler warning for gcc version 4.1.0 20060304
	and 64-bit CPU, which is rather pedantic about char * vs
	unsigned char * issues.

   !	Fixed possible off by one error for body chunks less than 20
   	bytes. Reported by Ben Lentz.

--0.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63.

   +	Add clamd-policy option in the event of an clamd socket error,
   	instead of always temporaily rejecting the mail. Sometimes its
   	better to let the mail keep flowing, so this option allows a
   	choice between none, accept, quarantine, later, reject, discard.

   -	Dropped policy=later since RFC 2821 4.1.1.4 DATA paragraph 4
   	states that its not possible to return partial failure after
   	receiving the message; either accept or reject.

  !!	clamdError(): fixed bug with second use of variable arguments
   	that was not reset before being reused.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Rejection based on access-db blacklisting now disabled. Some
	users prefer leaving blacklisting upto Sendmail and not the
	milter. Reported by Derek Balling and others.

  !!	filterBody(): Fixed obsecure bug when the message content is
	less than 20 bytes long, adding a terminating NUL to the body
	chunk for the trace log output actually overwrote off the end
	of a dynamic buffer on some Linux systems causing the milter
	to crash. Reported by Martin Lathoud.

--0.4--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61.

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.60.

   +	Add a brief comparision of milter-clamc vs. clamav.milter to
   	the documentation.

   !	The quarantine queue reason now includes the virus name.

   !	Increased default T= timeouts.

   -	Removed "message is clean" log entries as being overly verbose.
   	Only log infections.

   !	Reduce number of similar log messages for -p reject.

   !	Fixed invalid option error with too many printf format characters.

   +	Added "-p later" as a policy choice for consistency with other
   	milters.

   !	Change -T default from 60s to 300s.

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')

   +	Add -I option enable extra informational headers.

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.59.
